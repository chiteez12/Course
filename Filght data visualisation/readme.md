# Flight data analysis
In this project, we will analyse the flight data from seaborn library. We visualise it further for better comprehension.

Modules/Libraries used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. seaborn

This project has three features:
1. Plot and compare the no. of passengers in each month. It is done with the help of bar graph

2. Plot and compare the no. of passengers in each year. It is done with help of bar graph.

3. Plotting overall growth in the no. of passengers. It is done using a line graph


This project is great for beginners who want to practice data analysis and visualisation. It gives a great experience of real world data. It helps in practicing numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn with real world dataset.

Made with love and passion!
